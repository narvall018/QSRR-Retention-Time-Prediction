# Materials and methods

This chapter describes the methodology used to develop a QSRR model for retention time prediction. The workflow includes:

1. **Dataset description**: Description of the compounds dataset and experimental conditions
2. **Molecular descriptors**: Calculation and analysis of different molecular descriptors (2D, 3D, fingerprints, MQN)
3. **Feature selection**: Unsupervised and supervised methods for descriptor selection
4. **Model development**: Implementation and comparison of machine learning models

Each section contains detailed information about the methods and analyses performed.
