# Materials and Methods

This chapter describes the methodology used to develop a QSRR model for retention time prediction. The workflow includes:

1. **Dataset Description**: Description of the compounds dataset and experimental conditions
2. **Molecular Descriptors**: Calculation and analysis of different molecular descriptors (2D, 3D, fingerprints, MQN)
3. **Feature Selection**: Unsupervised and supervised methods for descriptor selection
4. **Model Development**: Implementation and comparison of machine learning models

Each section contains detailed information about the methods and analyses performed.
