# Introduction

## The challenge of compound identification in analytical chemistry
Analytical chemistry faces multiple technical constraints in the identification of unknown compounds in environmental samples {cite}`schymanski2014non`. The advent of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) allows the detection of thousands of compounds in a single analysis {cite}`kind2010advances`. However, the structural elucidation of these molecules requires multiple parameters to reach a sufficient level of identification confidence {cite}`hollender2017nontarget`. The identification process relies on the combination of several analytical parameters: exact mass measurement, isotopic pattern, MS/MS fragmentation pattern, and retention time {cite}`gago2015extended`. Each parameter contributes to increasing the level of confidence in the identification. Schymanski et al. established a classification system defining five confidence levels for compound identification, from level 5 (exact mass only) to level 1 (confirmation with reference standard) {cite}`schymanski2014identifying`. In environmental analysis, the lack of reference standards for many compounds, particularly transformation products, prevents reaching level 1 confidence {cite}`krauss2010lc`. This limitation affects various fields such as metabolomics and environmental monitoring. The retention time parameter can compensate for this absence of standards by providing additional identification evidence.

## Retention time in compound identification
Retention time adds complementary identification information to mass spectrometry data {cite}`creek2011toward`. In liquid chromatography, this parameter depends on the molecular interactions between analytes and the stationary phase. The parameters affecting retention time include mobile phase composition, gradient profile, column dimensions, temperature, and flow rate. The absence of standardized retention time databases stems from the variations in chromatographic conditions between laboratories. While mass spectrometry databases contain thousands of reference spectra, retention time data remains specific to each analytical setup {cite}`stanstrup2015predret`. The transfer of retention times between different chromatographic systems requires additional calculations and standardization methods. Several approaches exist to address retention time variability across systems. The use of retention indices, based on reference compounds, allows normalization of retention times {cite}`idroes2023anfis`. Another method involves the prediction of retention times through quantitative structure-retention relationship (QSRR) models {cite}`kumar2022qsrr`.

## QSRR Models as a solution
QSRR models establish mathematical correlations between molecular structures and retention times {cite}`kaliszan2007qsrr`. The model development requires a dataset of molecules with experimental retention times, measured with defined chromatographic parameters: column type, mobile phase composition, gradient profile, and temperature. These experimental conditions determine the scope of the model's predictions. Molecular descriptors translate chemical structures into numerical values. Physicochemical descriptors represent molecular weight, logP, and topological polar surface area {cite}`gorynski2013qsrr`. Molecular fingerprints generate binary patterns of structural features {cite}`rogers2010extended`. Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP) map circular fragments around atoms, while MACCS keys record predefined structural patterns {cite}`yang2019molecular`. The Molecular Quantum Numbers (MQN) describe molecules through atom counts, bond types, and topological patterns {cite}`awale2013mqn`. The resulting QSRR models predict retention times for new compounds under the same chromatographic conditions as the training dataset. This method provides retention time values for compounds without available reference standards.

## Project objectives
This research develops a QSRR model for retention time prediction in liquid chromatography. The model uses a dataset of experimentally measured retention times from compounds analyzed under standardized conditions. The predictions aim to support the identification of compounds without reference standards. The methodology incorporates molecular descriptor calculation from chemical structures and machine learning model development. Statistical metrics and external test sets validate the model's performance. The analysis determines prediction errors and defines acceptance thresholds for retention time windows.
